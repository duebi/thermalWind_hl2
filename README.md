# thermalWind_hl2

MATLAB routine to compute shear of U from a meridional transect of seaglider 146 (m11) under the thermal wind assumption. Brunt-Vaisala frequency and Richardson number are also computed.
In the common/ subfolder there are accessory routines:
- nanrunmean: computes running mean
- vdist: computes distances on the WGS-84 ellipsoid (by Michael Kleder)
